When they want to push boundaries, think about possibilities, or think about their next step.</p><p class="content-text">We think about users’ goals as much as we think about our clients’ goals. What do users need to do to succeed? And what about our clients? How do we make them look good to their bosses, to their users, to the design and tech communities?</p><p class="content-text">It’s <em>that</em> empathy that sets us apart. It runs deep.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="clients">With Better Clients</h2><p class="content-text">We don’t just take on any work. We don’t just work with any client. We like to focus on tough problems and great clients. Subjective, yes, but you know it when you see it.</p><p class="content-text">We succeed when we work with clients who care about UX, their own products, and progress. Intelligent, decisive people who aren’t afraid to try new things. People who respect us, want to learn, and aren’t satisfied with the status quo. People who want to do things better than they’re done today. Movers. Shakers. Winners.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="strategy">With More Rigorous Strategy</h2><p class="content-text">Any agency can make a pretty design. That’s table stakes, but it’s not UX. We go beyond the pixels, and deep into the strategy and philosophy behind the decisions we make.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Research</h3><p class="content-text">We rely on research that points to the best practices, and where it doesn’t exist, we do our own. We conduct studies that help us better define the problems our clients face and hypotheses, prototypes, or solutions we create. We believe that better knowledge and more complete information lead to better outcomes, every single time.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Information Architecture</h3><p class="content-text">Just like you can’t build a house without a blueprint, you can’t build a good digital product without IA. We invest the time to create thoughtful, precise documentation, flows, and wireframes that actually solve our clients’ problems, accounting for visual hierarchy, user paths, and mapping out the layout for each unique screen and how the various components will appear on different devices or viewports.</p><p class="content-text">For Brave, defensible IA is the foundation of our UX decisions and philosophy. It is both the sign and result of our best thinking, where our questions become answers and our most visionary ideas become realistic plans.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="execution">More Adventurous Execution</h2><p class="content-text">We’re not happy with good enough. We prefer great. And in that spirit, we push each other to try explore new ideas, constantly asking ourselves and each other, “is this possible?”</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Our Visual Design</h3><p class="content-text">Make no mistake: design matters. Users often make irrational decisions, and deciding to use or not use your product may be based on whether they find it visually appealing.</p><p class="content-text">We bring our wireframes to life with colors, textures, stroke weights, typography, photography, and iconography that aim to delight users. Our design is more than a coat of paint – it addresses aesthetic usability, interaction and animation patterns, and strives to push the limits of technology.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Development</h3><p class="content-text">At the end of the day, these designs have to work. And users have to use them, interact with them, and come back to them. We might as well make them happy.</p><p class="content-text">We build interfaces meticulously, thinking first about the holistic system, and building the common structure and components to ensure it is lightweight, lean, and bug-free. The build is the culmination of the whole project, so the stakes are high.</p><p class="content-text">Our team possesses the dev skills and fundamental understanding of business goals, the UX philosophy applied to the product, and the constraints or possibilities of the underlying technology. And from there, it’s just a matter of clean, reliable code bringing the whole thing to life.</p><p class="content-text">Disclaimer: Code is not always part of our set of deliverables. Oftentimes, we hand over design files (with lots of documentation!) for our clients to build out the solutions on their end.</p><h1 class="content-title" id="our-values">Our Values</h1><blockquote class="content-blockquote">At Brave, you’re going to meet great people. Learn, grow, and improve. Do great work. Explore and create. Ultimately, you’re going to love it here.</blockquote><h2 class="content-section" id="meet">Meet Great People</h2><p class="content-text">You’ve got talent. It’s one of the reasons you’re here. And so does everyone else sitting (or standing) around you. But when we all work together, we can do extraordinary things.</p><p class="content-text">We already talked about empathy, but it’s going to keep coming up. The reason we succeed is because we care about each other and our clients. We use our talents to make the team better as a whole and our projects better individually. We take the time to teach each other the things we know, and we listen to those who are teaching us. We care about making work easier and better for our colleagues, so we go the extra mile.</p><p class="content-text">We have some of the smartest, most creative people in the city working at Brave, pushing the limits to accomplish greatness. We are small, but mighty. With a team of our size, every single person is vital to our success. We don’t have a B-Team. We wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="learn">Learn, Grow, and Improve</h2><p class="content-text">We are lucky to work in UX, a field that is rapidly expanding, constantly changing, and always requiring new skills and thinking. For some, that kind of pace is too daunting. But for the Brave, it’s what gets us up in the morning.</p><p class="content-text">Our whole team is hungry for knowledge and for testing the boundaries and limits of what is possible. We’re willing to try and fail, so long as we learn something. So long as we stay hungry, try hard, and keep growing.</p><p class="content-text">That drive to learn and improve and grow is one of the most important things in finding the right fit for Brave. We don’t just want knowledge for ourselves, either. We educate our teammates on the nuances and theory behind what we do.</p><p class="content-text">And we take it one step further — we educate our clients too. Because an informed client makes better decisions, builds a better product, and partners with us to tackle even more difficult UX problems. It’s a positive chain reaction that keeps us moving on this wild adventure.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="great-work">Do Great Work</h2><p class="content-text">You know why we succeed every day? You know why our clients love us, trust us, and keep coming back? Because we approach our client projects, products, and problems with intent. Because we actually care about coming up with <strong>game-changing ideas</strong> that are <strong>sound and defensible from a strategic, visual, and technical perspective</strong>. That’s heavy. Let that sink in.</p><p class="content-text">Our work takes brainpower, talent, and execution. It takes care, time, and passion. We put everything we’ve got into what we do. From ideation to execution. From reimagining UIs for existing apps to creating them from scratch. From complex websites to data-heavy app interfaces. From research to IA to visual design to development.</p><p class="content-text">When inspiration strikes, we aren’t afraid to go beyond delivering client work. If we have a great idea and want to see it live, we don’t wait around for someone else to make it happen. We take on the challenge ourselves.</p><p class="content-text">To date, our internal products include the following:</p><ul><li class="content-text"><a href="http://braveux.com/bravery/" class="content-link" target="_blank">Bravery</a>, our weekly newsletter, providing the best UX reads to subscribers</li><li class="content-text"><a href="http://fightforux.com/" class="content-link" target="_blank">Fight for UX</a>, a call-to-arms poster series promoting core UX principles</li><li class="content-text"><a href="http://forthebadge.com/" class="content-link" target="_blank">For the Badge</a>, a for-fun site celebrating developers’ doing things for badge’s sake</li><li class="content-text"><a href="http://compass.is/" class="content-link" target="_blank">Compass</a>, a real-time dashboard displaying time, commute, and weather information</li></ul><h2 class="content-section" id="explore">Explore and Create</h2><p class="content-text">Fundamentally, we’re creative professionals. We like art and engineering, design and dev, form and function. Curiosity comes hard-wired, and we love to solve problems.</p><p class="content-text">We ask big questions like <strong><em>how</em></strong> and <strong><em>what if</em></strong> and <strong><em>what’s next</em></strong>? We challenge conventional ideas and try new things. We’re always curious and exploring, trying to push the limits beyond what we’ve already accomplished. We don’t stand still.</p><p class="content-text">Because in this industry, it’s too easy to get left behind. And those who get left behind are the first ones picked off. So we don’t just like to keep pace, we like to lead. <strong>Because the path forward is forged by the Brave</strong>.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="love">Love It</h2><p class="content-text">Life is too short to waste time doing something you don’t care about. We’re here because we love it. Because it matters to us. We spend full days at the office, dreaming up, designing, and building the next big thing. Constantly thinking about what could be and how we can make it happen.</p><p class="content-text">We believe that anything worth doing is worth doing well, right, and with the full thrust of your heart and mind. And look, this isn’t just a cake walk. We solve big problems and have tough days. But we have each other, we have great clients, and at the end of the day, the hardest path can lead you to the highest peak. And the view from up here is extraordinary.</p><h1 class="content-title" id="our-work-life">Our Work Life</h1><h2 class="content-section" id="logistics">Logistics</h2><p class="content-text">If you want to do great work, it’s best to do it in an inspiring workspace that allows room for your creativity. Better to be surrounded by the people who care most about what you’re doing. Better to do it in a place with good energy, good people, and good lunch options.</p><p class="content-text">We’ve customized a space, striving to provide those things. Welcome to Brave.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Our Office</h3><p class="content-text">Our office is located in the first floor of 1705 DeSales St NW, Washington, DC 20036. No lobby. No elevators. Just walk right in from the street. There’s a sign above our space, and our name is on the door. We’re right behind the Mayflower Hotel, home of a lot of this city’s rich history. In the heart of downtown DC, we’ve made a wonderful home for ourselves.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Hours &amp; The Daily Hustle</h3><p class="content-text">Our working hours have historically been 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Monday through Thursday, and 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Fridays. This policy has shifted slightly to allow for more flexibility, with an option to start work up to an hour early, beginning at 8:00 AM, on days where there are no conflicting meetings.</p><p class="content-text">At 9:00 AM sharp, we start our day as a team with a morning huddle, doing a whip-around from teammate to teammate to understand what each person is working on, what meetings are happening that day, and any roadblocks, obstacles, or touchpoints we’ll need to navigate.</p><p class="content-text">After huddle, we break and get to work. Not sure how else to put it: we get the damn job done.</p><p class="content-text">We’re big on work-life balance. Working here means working hard during the day, and going home at a reasonable hour to enjoy your life.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Our Space</h3><p class="content-text">We’re really proud of our unique, custom, office space. We’ve got a bright and beautiful meeting space in the front, greeting our clients as they walk through the door. We have multiple, modular collaboration spaces with 4K displays and whiteboards on wheels for ideas big and small. And in the back, our dedicated workspace, that’s where the magic happens. We’ve all got mechanical standing desks that go up and down, depending on our mood and energy level.</p><p class="content-text">By design, we’re very careful about how we use doors or closed spaces. We like to keep the three parts of our space open and flexible, consistent with our mindset about projects, working, and creativity. This kind of flexibility lets us easily re-configure our office layout depending on whether we need to set up for an event, optimal project communication, or for heads-down focus time.</p><p class="content-text">That’s not to say it doesn’t have its drawbacks - sound travels, and it is important to figure out how best to focus, especially at crunch time. So whether it’s getting in your zone in your headphones, seeking refuge in a breakout space, or just asking your teammates to pretend you’re on another planet, we understand and respect that. Mars seems very productive this time of day.</p><p class="content-text">Maybe it’s not for everyone, but it wasn’t designed to be. Our office was built specifically for us.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Attire</h3><p class="content-text">We have a casual dress code. It is acceptable for employees to wear jeans and hoodies, shorts and tees, or other casual attire, unless we’re (a) attending a work event, (b) seeing new clients, or (c) seeing clients that require more professional dress standards. We dress to the level expected of us.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="communcation">Communication</h2><h3 class="content-subsection">Our Tone</h3><p class="content-text">We tend to communicate casually within our own organization. Though we joke a lot, we do not joke about race, color, religion, gender expression/identity, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status, military or veteran status, age and/or disability. If you think your comment or joke would make someone uncomfortable, keep it to yourself. If someone tells you it’s offensive, apologize and don’t do it again. It’s pretty simple and will allow us to keep things casual but professional.</p><p class="content-text">There are a few very important exceptions, when we’re more professional than casual:</p><h3 class="content-subsection">With Our Clients</h3><p class="content-text">Everything that goes to a client needs to be professional. Part of our credibility comes from being smart, studied, and articulate, so our tone and language in meetings, emails, and other communications must reflect that.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">When We Disagree</h3><p class="content-text">We also communicate with a professional tone when addressing conflict, differences of opinion, and providing/receiving feedback. It is ineffective to be anything but clear and objective when you’re talking about someone’s work or how someone bothered you. This is a promise: if you can maintain your professionalism under these circumstances, you will be a better, more effective team member every time.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="social-events">Social Events</h2><p class="content-text">Important announcement: we aren’t robots. We like to have fun. The work we do is important to us, but it’s not the only thing that keeps us motivated or makes us feel passionate about working at Brave. We talk a lot about great people, and it takes time and effort to build that kind of trust, relationship, and culture where a team can hit its stride.</p><p class="content-text">We make a point of enjoying each others’ company, taking a break from our work week in addition to time outside work.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Weekly Lunch</h3><p class="content-text">One day per week, Brave buys lunch and we sit down to eat together. It’s a time to disconnect from whatever we’re working on, ignore our emails and phone calls and texts, and just hang out.</p><p class="content-text">After we review our PM tool, we’ll jump into the presentation of that week’s “Brave Notion,” where we hear from one of our team members about something they learned, picked up on, or want us to know about. It’s our way of staying connected with each other on the nuances of our workflow that we might not have learned about otherwise. We present on a rotating basis, so it stays fresh, and no one has to present more than once every couple of months.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Monthly Outing</h3><p class="content-text">Once a month, we do something fun outside the office. We try to do a variety of things: game night, team dinner, sporting events, volunteering, improv performances, and bring-the-whole-fam-BBQs. Again, we’re always looking for new ideas. Fun things that will break the monotony and give us an excuse to try something new.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Quarterly Retreat</h3><p class="content-text">There’s a whole world outside our office walls. Endless points of data for us to experience, which will not only help us cut loose and enjoy ourselves, but may just teach us something important too. After all, there are people to understand, natural and manmade beauty to observe, and devices/objects that may shape the way we view interactions. We’d be doing ourselves a disservice if we didn’t try to experience a world that inspires us to think more creatively.</p><p class="content-text">These retreats don’t take place in boring hotel conference rooms. They don’t include uninteresting seminars with no-name keynote speakers and PowerPoint presentations.</p><p class="content-text">Our retreats are about exploration. That’s at the soul of what Brave is.</p><p class="content-text">Sometimes, we stay overnight. Other times, it’s a local day trip. We’ve taken trips as far as New Orleans, and as close as Bluemont, Virginia. We’ve laser-tagged, mini-golfed, explored museums...we’ve even gone indoor skydiving!</p><h1 class="content-title" id="our-tools">Our Tools</h1><p class="content-text">So, how do we actually do the work we do? We’ve got tools, we’ve got processes, we’ve got habits. In your day to day life at Brave, here’s what you can expect to use.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="communication">Communication</h2><h3 class="content-subsection">Slack</h3><p class="content-text">Aside from in-person meetings or conversations, Slack is our primary means for communicating at Brave. As an instant messenger client, Slack lets us share files, ask questions, and occasionally (OK, OK, pretty often) share a reaction GIF or emoji.</p><p class="content-text">We use several channels for our communication in Slack. You can communicate 1-on-1 with your teammates, or participate in these channels:</p><ul><li class="content-text">#general - sharing UX news, updates, and anything relevant to the field or client work</li><li class="content-text">#digest-links - a place to share potential articles or resources for us to link to in our weekly Bravery newsletter. Be sure to include your own analysis!</li><li class="content-text">#diversions - typically a place for funny links/GIFs or other “I need someone to see this thing” distractions</li></ul><p class="content-text">Additionally, we have a lot of one-on-one and smaller group conversations within Slack, so that we can all be on the same page for smaller conversations or exchanges that don’t require a meeting or emails.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Gmail</h3><p class="content-text">We primarily use email for communicating with clients. Email is a great place for longform explanations and analysis. It’s a place where your tone should be professional, your grammar and syntax on-point, and your message/action items should be clear.</p><p class="content-text">Every team member needs to actively monitor his or her email. Occasionally, clients will route an email directly to you. So, do yourself and your team a favor and check it regularly.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Zoom</h3><p class="content-text">When meeting with clients virtually, we use Zoom, our favorite platform for phone, video, and screen share conferencing. With a Google Calendar plugin, a Zoom link will automatically generate within the meeting invite, which makes it very convenient. We also use Zoom to record our meetings, and distribute links to our clients for review.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Google Meet / Slack Video</h3><p class="content-text">On occasion, we use Google Meet and/or Slack video calls to connect as a team, or with potential clients, partners, etc.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="storage">Storage</h2><h3 class="content-subsection">Dropbox</h3><p class="content-text">We use Dropbox for all client project assets, as well as for Brave internal, marketing, branding efforts, and products. Dropbox has better syncing and conflict management than Google Drive, making it a superior option for design file management, in particular.</p><p class="content-text">Each client or project will have its own folder on Dropbox, but it is important to keep the files and assets as organized as possible, following the typical conventions we have used to date.</p><p class="content-text">When sharing links from Dropbox, be sure to create a shareable link for client access.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Google Drive</h3><p class="content-text">We use Google Drive as a repository for notes, spreadsheets, and text files. Because of the sharing and real-time editing functionality, Google Drive offers the best workflow for sharing, updating, and collaborating on documents and worksheets.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="presentation">Presentation</h2><h3 class="content-subsection">Invision</h3><p class="content-text">We create clickable, web-based prototypes with Invision. These prototypes are great for user testing, articulating a complex idea, or getting a sanity check from developers.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Qwilr</h3><p class="content-text">When sending out proposals, we use Qwilr, which provides a sleek, branded digital experience and allows clients to sign our agreements quickly and paper-free. When drafting business development/sales proposals, it’s important to use the existing brand styles and language for consistency and efficiency.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="tracking">Tracking</h2><h3 class="content-subsection">Google Calendar</h3><p class="content-text">All meetings and appointments scheduled during the workweek must be updated on your Brave UX Google Calendar. Your teammates will use your calendar regularly while scheduling meetings with clients or team events, so it is crucial that you keep it as current as possible, to prevent double-booking or the need to cancel/reschedule.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Productive</h3><p class="content-text">We use Productive to track our high-level tasks, and our time spent working each day. At Brave, we track to the nearest 15 minutes, accounting for a minimum of eight (8) hours per day and 40 hours per week (including an hour tracked for weekly team lunch). When tracking time in Productive, be descriptive with regard to your activity, accounting for the specific tasks you completed (either directly from the task card, or through a manual entry) and the time it took you for each; accurate time tracking is crucial so we can understand how our time is spent and how better to estimate future work.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">PM Tool</h3><p class="content-text">We use a Brave-built PM Tool that breaks down our daily work responsibilities, our projects as they move through phases, and a general “Rhythm” tab that gives us a combined understanding of project progress and overall bandwidth. We review this on a weekly basis, providing additional context as necessary.</p><h2 class="content-section" id="production">Production</h2><h3 class="content-subsection">Sketch</h3><p class="content-text">Bohemian Coding’s Sketch is our primary system design tool for visual mockups. Together with a Brave-curated set of Sketch plug-ins, Sketch allows us to create and manage complex design systems with consistent colors, modules, patterns, and even responsive reflow behaviors.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Adobe XD</h3><p class="content-text">While recently out of beta, Adobe Experience Design has shown to be a powerful tool for information architecture. It strikes the right balance between creating a consistent wireframe hierarchy, without over-prescribing or limiting what we can later do in visual design. It also has flow-mapping and prototyping built into the product itself, giving us an efficient workflow.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Adobe Illustrator</h3><p class="content-text">Adobe Illustrator CC was formerly our primary UX design tool. Instead, we now focus on its strengths: vector- and type-based artwork and illustrations, as well as brand, logo and iconography work.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Adobe Photoshop</h3><p class="content-text">We use Adobe Photoshop CC for what it does best - perfecting photos both real and imagined. It’s also great for any visual that relies on textures, and Photoshop assets often make an appearance within our Illustrator layouts and elsewhere.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Adobe InDesign</h3><p class="content-text">Adobe InDesign CC is our workhorse for printed deliverables with a ton of content, like end-of-year reports, articles and program guides.</p><h3 class="content-subsection">Adobe Animate</h3><p class="content-text">Adobe Animate CC is our go-to tool for slick loading animations, lightweight interface motion concepts and illustrated animated GIFs.
